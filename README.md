# WordPress-to-lead for Salesforce CRM #

WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your Salesforce.com account!

## Description ##

WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your [Salesforce CRM](http://www.salesforce.com) account! People can enter a contact form on your site, and the lead goes straight into Salesforce CRM: no more copy pasting lead info, no more missing leads: each and every one of them is in Salesforce.com for you to follow up.

You can fully configure all the different settings for the form, and then use a shortcode to insert the form into your posts or pages, or you can use the widget that comes with the plugin and insert the form into your sidebar!
