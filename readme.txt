WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your Salesforce.com account!

== Description ==

WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your [Salesforce CRM](http://www.salesforce.com) account! People can enter a contact form on your site, and the lead goes straight into Salesforce CRM: no more copy pasting lead info, no more missing leads: each and every one of them is in Salesforce.com for you to follow up.

You can fully configure all the different settings for the form, and then use a shortcode to insert the form into your posts or pages, or you can use the widget that comes with the plugin and insert the form into your sidebar!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find my Salesforce organisation ID? =
To find your Organisation ID, do the following steps:
* log in to your SalesForce.com account
* go to Setup &raquo; Company Profile &raquo; Company Information
* you'll find the Organisation ID in the lower right hand corner of your screen

= How do I change the order of input fields? =
Right now, the only way of ordering input fields is by changing the position numbers on the right hand side of the input fields table in the admin settings.

= How do I apply my own styling to the form? =
Disable the "Use Form CSS" checkbox, and copy the form css to your own css file, then start modifying it!

= Is it possible to make multiple forms with this plugin? =
Yes, version 2.0 introduces this feature.

= How do I change the Lead Source that shows up in Salesforce? =
You can easily change this by going into the WordPress-to-Lead admin panel and, under form settings, changing the Lead Source for that form.

= Can I change the submit button? =
Of course you can! Go into the WordPress-to-Lead admin panel and, under Form Settings, change the text from the default "Submit" to whatever you'd like it to be!

= Will I lose data if I upgrade? Do I need to change anything? =
No, the plugin will migrate your existing data to the new format. Your existing form will become Form 1 and be output by the [salesforce] shortcode).

= How do I show my other forms? =
Just use `[salesforce form="X"]` (X is the form number).
Or select a form number in the widget.

= I put my campaign name in the Campaign_ID field but it's not working =
The Campaign_ID field requires the Campaign ID -- the name will not work. To find the Campaign_ID, go your the campaign page and look in the URL bar for the ID:

e.g. https://salesforce.com/621U000000IJat

In this example, 621U000000IJat is the Campaign_ID -- make sure you use the ID from the campaign you want the lead attached to and not the example ID shown here.

= Does the return/thanks URL have to be on my site? =
No, as long as it's a valid URL it will work. However it should be an absolute URL regardless of where it is located.
e.g. http://yoursite.com/thanks/ not just /thanks/
