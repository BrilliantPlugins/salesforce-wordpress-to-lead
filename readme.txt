Brilliant Web-to-Lead for Salesforce creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your Salesforce.com account!

== Description ==

Brilliant Web-to-Lead for Salesforce creates a solid integration between your WordPress install(s) and your [Salesforce CRM](http://www.salesforce.com) account! People can enter a contact form on your site, and the lead (or case) goes straight into Salesforce CRM: no more copy pasting lead info, no more missing leads: each and every one of them is in Salesforce.com for you to follow up.

### Check out the screencast

You can fully configure all the different settings for the form, and then use a shortcode to insert the form into your posts or pages, or you can use the widget that comes with the plugin and insert the form into your sidebar!

Please see this [Demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnMzkxPUIyc) to get a full grasp of some of the power this plugin holds (though it's a bit outdated!).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install via the Add New Plugin menu
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enter your Salesforce.com Organization ID on the plugin configuration page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin have any hooks or filters? Is there documentation? =

Yes, quite a few.

[Hooks & Filters Documentation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/salesforce-wordpress-to-lead/other_notes/)

= I'm not seeing any errors, but the entry didn't get added to Salesforce! =

To turn on in browser debugging, add a hidden field (enabled) named `debug` and set the value to `1`.

To turn on debugging via email,  add a hidden field (enabled) named `debugEmail` and set the value to `you@yourdomain.com` (your email address).

Also check for debug logs at SalesForce to see if a validation rule is the culprit: `Administration Setup | Monitoring | Debug Logs`.

= What are the built in field names? Not all the fields are working when I use the Field Label in the lead edit screen? =

SalesForce is inconsistent in naming built in fields, and even misreports the names of some fields (like `MobilePhone`, which is actually `mobile`) in the customize fields screen. Generating a Web to Lead form gets you the real names, but the list below should help as well.

= How do I setup Web to Lead/Case for my SalesForce Account? =

[Setting Up Web-to-Lead](http://login.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/setting_up_web-to-lead.htm)

[Setting Up Web-to-Case](http://login.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/setting_up_web-to-case.htm)

= How do I setup a Web to Case form? =
Choose _Web to Case_ in the **Form Settings** (bottom of the form editor page).

= Where do I find my Salesforce organization ID? =
To find your Organization ID, do the following steps:

1. Log in to your SalesForce.com account
2. Go to Setup &raquo; Company Profile &raquo; Company Information
3. You'll find the Organization ID in the lower right hand corner of your screen

= How do I use a SalesForce custom field? =

1. Go to Setup &raquo; Customize &raquo; Leads &raquo; Fields
1. If your custom field does not exist yet, create it now.
1. Find the API Name for your field (e.g. Custom_Field_Example__c). If it doesn't end in "__c" it's not the API name and will not work.
1. Add a new field to your form using the form editor on the plugin admin screen
1. Enter the API Name as the field name (left most box), then fill out the other fields normally (make sure to enable the field!).
1. Save your changes -- new submissions will now post that custom field to SalesForce.

= How do I use the checkbox field? =
Like any other field. Note that it is a single checkbox, not a checkbox list (yet).

*Note:* You must provide a value for your checkbox. Generally `1` is what you want (unless you're expecting something other than true/false in SalesForce). If you don't provide a value, your checkbox will never get sent with the form data (and even if it did, it won’t "check" the box at SalesForce as "empty" = unchecked).

_Checkbox lists and radio buttons will be in a future update._

= How do I pre-check a checkbox? =
Before you do, consider if a pre-checked checkbox (opt-out) is [really what you want to do](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2002/03/opt_in_matters_.html).

If you insist on proceeding anyways: see the _Pre-check a checkbox_ example in [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/salesforce-wordpress-to-lead/other_notes/).

= How do I use the select (picklist) field? =

**Hint: Use the form importer!**

Use it like any other field -- however you'll need to specify the options (and optional values) for each field using the options box (far right). You'll also need to use the "internal name" from Salesforce as your field name (see next FAQ).

The value box for a select list is the default value (the one selected on a fresh form).

`
/* Preferred format: */

// Use same data for display and value passed to SF
one
two
three

// Use different data for display and value passed to SF, require user to select something (assuming field is required)
Select One|
name1|value1
name2|value2

// Use different data for display and value passed to SF
name1|value1
name2|value2

/* Legacy Format (does not allow the use of colons in names or values): */

//Use same data for display and value passed to SF
one|two|three

//Use different data for display and value passed to SF, require user to select something (assuming field is required)
Select One: | name1:value1 | name2:value2

//Use different data for display and value passed to SF
name1:value1 | name2:value2
`

Some useful options lists -- you can remove any line(s) you don't want/need:

_*Note:* If state and country aren't a valid combo, or the state doesn’t match the default country of your Salesforce install, your lead will likely be rejected -- so be careful with these!_

= How do I use the Date field? =

Choose it from the dropdown, that's all you *have* to do.

If you want to customize the date format or display/functionality of the datepicker UI, you can set the options by entering a list of options in the Options box of the field editor, one per line. Note that you must end each option with a comma, or you'll end up with a javascript error instead of a datepicker.

e.g.

Default date format - Year, Month, Day
`dateFormat : 'yy-mm-dd',`

Month, Day, Year
`dateFormat : 'mm-dd-yy',`

Day, Month, Year
`dateFormat : 'dd-mm-yy',`

Day, Month, Year + Show the button panel
`
dateFormat : 'dd-mm-yy',
showButtonPanel: true,
`

More information about the datepicker options can be found here:

1. Examples: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/

= How do I find the "internal name" of my picklist field? =

**Hint: Use the form importer!**

Picklists in SalesForce (Web to Lead at least) are a strange beast -- you'd think you could pass the field name and SF would map it on their end... but they don't make it that easy. Instead you need to use the internal SF ID of the picklist... which looks more like: `00Nd0000007p1Ej` (this is just en example, this is not the id of your field).

Where do you find this cryptic value? You can find it in two places (that I know of):

1. Edit the field and it'll be in the URL:
e.g. `https://na14.salesforce.com/00Nd0000007p1Ej/...`

2. Generate a Web to Lead form with your field included and it'll be in the HTML
e.g. `TestPicklist: <select  id="00Nd0000007p1Ej" name="00Nd0000007p1Ej" title="TestPicklist">`

Then take the "name" you get (00Nd0000007p1Ej in this example) and enter that as the *field name* in your form editor. Yes, you enter this obtuse string of digits instead of the human readable field name (i.e. MyCustomField__c).

= How do I use the HTML field? =

1. Optionally enter a label (field will display full width if a label is not entered.
2. Enter HTML code in the options box.

_Note: You cannot use the HTML box to enter a custom field, as only "known" fields are submitted to salesforce and HTML fields are not submitted (just displayed). Be careful to avoid the `<form>` or `</form>` tags in an HTML field as they will likely break your form._

= How do I use a lookup field with a picklist field in the plugin? =

**Hint: Use the form importer!**

Since it's a lookup field the value of the options has to be SalesForce's <strong>internal id</strong>, not the value you'd think it would be. Otherwise when Jane Doe gets married and becomes Jane Smith you'd break all the links to her user.

Basically, you need to generate a Web to Lead form in Salesforce and grab the option values from the HTML it generates.

e.g.

Find the lookup field. This is the bit you're looking for:
`<option value="00Nd0000007p1Ej">Joe Schmoe</option>`
`<option value="00Nd0000007p1aB">Jane Doe</option>`
...

00Nd0000007p1Ej (just an example) is the SF internal ID for that choive. Enter that as the value in your pick list field options like this:

`00Nd0000007p1Ej:Joe Schmoe|00Nd0000007p1aB:Jane Doe`

= How do I change the order of input fields? =
Right now, the only way of ordering input fields is by changing the position numbers on the right hand side of the input fields table in the admin settings. Drag and drop re-ordering is on the roadmap.

= How do I apply my own styling to the form? =
Instructions for disabling or overriding the CSS are included on the plugin settings screen (see Style Settings).

= What does "Use WPCF7 CSS integration" do? =
This option adds the WPCF7 classes to the form fields so you get the WPCF7 CSS styles applied (if that plugin is also activated).

= Is it possible to make multiple forms with this plugin? =
Yes, version 2.0 introduces this feature.
Version 2.1 allows you to duplicate forms to reduce re-entering data.
Version 2.5 allows you to import Web-to-Lead forms from Salesforce.

= How do I change the Lead Source that shows up in Salesforce? =
You can easily change this by going into the admin panel and, under form settings, changing the Lead Source for that form. Daddy Analytics uers can set this to blank to have it automatically filled.

= I want to include the full URL the form is embedded on, but SF limits the lead source to 40 characters -- how would I do that? =

The lead source supports using %URL% as the lead source (which will be replaced with the form embed url), but SF inexplicably limits the lead source to 40 characters.

Here's how to route around that:

`
/*
How to use:
1. Create a custom URL field at SalesForce (or Text field that holds more than 255 characters if you desire). A URL field makes it clickable in the lead detail view(s).
2. Replace URL_CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME below with the name of the custom field you setup in SalesForce,
   it will be something like EmbedUrl__c
3. Add a hidden field to each form with the same field name (e.g. "EmbedUrl__c")
4. Profit
*/

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_embedurl', 10, 3 );
function salesforce_w2l_field_embedurl( $val, $field, $form ){

    // Target a specific field on all forms
    if( $field == 'URL_CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME' )
         $val = esc_url("http://".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

    return $val;

}
`

https://gist.github.com/nciske/10047552

= Can I change the submit button? =
Of course you can! Go into the admin panel and, under Form Settings, change the text from the default "Submit" to whatever you'd like it to be!

= Will I lose data if I upgrade to 2.0? Do I need to change anything? =
Nope! The plugin will migrate your existing data to the new format. Your existing form will become Form 1 and be output by the [salesforce] shortcode).

= How do I show my other forms? =
Just use `[salesforce form="X"]` (X is the form number).
Or select a form number in the widget.

= I put my campaign name in the Campaign_ID field but it's not working =
The Campaign_ID field requires the Campaign ID -- the name will not work. To find the Campaign_ID, go your the campaign page and look in the URL bar for the ID:

e.g. https://salesforce.com/621U000000IJat

In this example, 621U000000IJat is the Campaign_ID -- make sure you use the ID from the campaign you want the lead attached to and not the example ID shown here.

= Does the return/thanks URL have to be on my site? =
No, as long as it's a valid URL it will work. However it should be an absolute URL regardless of where it is located.
e.g. http://yoursite.com/thanks/ not just /thanks/

= Is there a limit to how many leads can be captured? =
While the plugin has no limits, SalesForce does limit API calls per day:

_The daily limit for Web-to-Lead requests is 500. If your organization exceeds its daily Web-to-Lead limit, the Default Lead Creator (specified in the Web-to-Lead setup page) receives an email containing the additional lead information._

See also: [How many leads can we capture from our website?](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=faq_leads_how_many_leads.htm&language=en_US#faq_leads_how_many_leads)

= Can I hide the admin message insisting I enter my organization id? =

Yes. Be careful -- that's there to remind you that the plugin doesn't do much without one.

Add this to functions.php or a custom plugin (see other notes for more detailed instructions):

`
add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_show_admin_nag_message', '__return_false', 10, 1 );
`

== Filters and Hooks ==

**Note:**

* These should be placed in your active theme functions.php or a functionality plugin.
* Never edit a plugin directly (unless you understand the implications of doing so).
* You can use Pluginception to create a custom plugin for these to make them independent of your theme: https://wordpress.org/plugins/pluginception/

= Filters =

**salesforce_w2l_api_url**

Change the API url the plugin posts data to. Passes the form type (lead or case)

`
add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_api_url', 'my_w2l_api_url', 10, 2 );

function my_w2l_api_url( $url, $form_type ){
	return 'https://my.custom-api-url.com/something/';
}
`

**sfwp2l_validate_field**

Provide your own validation logic for each field.

_An error array is passed in, along with the field name, submitted value, and field configuration (type, default value, required, etc)._

Here's an example of blocking common free email providers:

`
add_filter('sfwp2l_validate_field','block_non_biz_emails', 10, 4);

function block_non_biz_emails( $error, $name, $val, $field ){

	if( $name == 'email' ){

		$non_biz_domains = array( 'gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', 'hotmail.com', 'aol.com' );

		$domain = array_pop(explode('@', $val));

		if( in_array( $domain, $non_biz_domains ) ){
			$error['valid'] = false;
			$error['message'] = 'Please enter a business email addresss.';
		}

	}

	return $error;
}
`

You can add to the $non_biz_domains to block other providers as well.

**salesforce_w2l_form_html**

HTML of the form before it's returned to WordPress for display

**salesforce_w2l_cc_user_from_name**

Change from name (user confirmation)

**salesforce_w2l_cc_user_from_email**

Change from email (user confirmation)

**salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_from_name**

Change from name (admin notification)

**salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_from_email**

Change from email (admin notification)

**salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_email_list**

Adding this code to your functions.php file will add 3 emails to the list. You can add as many as you want and each will get an admin notification email.

`
add_filter('salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_email_list','salesforce_add_emails');

function salesforce_add_emails( $emails ){

//uncomment line below to remove site admin
//unset($emails[0]);

$emails[]='email@domain.com';
$emails[]='email2@domain.com';
$emails[]='email3@domain.com';

return $emails;
}
`

**salesforce_w2l_cc_user_email_content**

**salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_email_content**

Allows you to filter (append, prepend, modify) the email message content sent to the user or admin(s).

`
add_filter('salesforce_w2l_cc_user_email_content','salesforce_filter_user_message', 10, 1);

function salesforce_filter_user_message( $message ){

	$message = 'Before the user message' . "\r\n\r\n" . $message . "\r\n\r\n" . 'After the user message';

	return $message;

}

add_filter('salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_email_content','salesforce_filter_admin_message', 10, 1);

function salesforce_filter_admin_message( $message ){

	$message = 'Before the admin message' . "\r\n\r\n" . $message . "\r\n\r\n" . 'After the admin message';

	return $message;

}
`

**salesforce_w2l_cc_admin_replyto_email**

Filter the Reply-To email header (e.g. to allow replies to go to the form submitter)

**salesforce_w2l_returl**

**salesforce_w2l_returl_{Form ID}**

Allows you to filter the value of a field before it is output to dynamically populate it with a value, auto set it based on another value, etc.

Examples:

`

// Filter Return/Success URL on a specific form
// salesforce_w2l_returl_{Form ID}
add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_returl_1_tester', 'salesforce_w2l_returl_1_tester_example', 10, 1 );
function salesforce_w2l_returl_1_tester_example(  $returl ){

	return 'http://123.com';

}
`

**salesforce_w2l_success_message**

**salesforce_w2l_success_message_{Form ID}**

Allows you to filter the contents of the success message before it is output to dynamically populate it with a value, auto set it based on another value, etc.

Examples:

`

// Filter Success Message on a specific form
// salesforce_w2l_success_message_{Form ID}
add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_success_message_1_tester', 'salesforce_w2l_success_message_1_tester_example', 10, 1 );
function salesforce_w2l_success_message_1_tester_example(  $success ){

	return 'Testing 123';

}
`

**salesforce_w2l_field_value**

**salesforce_w2l_field_value_{Form ID}_{Field Name}**

Allows you to filter the value of a field before it is output to dynamically populate it with a value, auto set it based on another value, etc.

Note that the second filter requires you to replace {Form ID} and {Field Name} to be replaced with the relevant form id and field name.

If you need access to the field or form settings in your filter you can use:

`$field = salesforce_get_field( $field_name, $form_id );`

`$form = salesforce_get_form( $form_id );`

Examples:

`
// Pre-check a checkbox

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_value_precheck_example', 10, 3 );

function salesforce_w2l_field_value_precheck_example( $val, $field, $form ){

	$form_id = 1; // form id to act upon
	$field_name = 'checkboxfield__c'; // API Name of the field you want to auto check

	if( $form == $form_id && $field_name == $field && ! $_POST )
		return 1; // or whatever the value of your checkbox is

	return $val;

}
`

`
// Store HTTP referrer in a field (this is not 100% reliable as the browser sends this value to the server)

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_value_referrer_example', 10, 3 );

function salesforce_w2l_field_value_referrer_example( $val, $field, $form ){

	$form_id = 1; // form id to act upon
	$field_name = 'referrer__c'; // API Name of the field you want to autofill

	if( $form == $form_id && $field_name == $field ){
		if( isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] ) ){
			return $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
		}
	}

	return $val;

}
`

`
// Autofill fields based on thew query string (using Google Analytics tracking variables in this example)

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_value_querystring_example', 10, 3 );

function salesforce_w2l_field_value_querystring_example( $val, $field, $form ){

	$form_id = 1; // form id to act upon
	$field_name = 'source__c'; // API Name of the field you want to autofill
	$qs_var = 'source'; // e.g. ?source=foo

	if( $form == $form_id && $field_name == $field ){
		if( isset( $_GET[ $qs_var ] ) ){
			return $_GET[ $qs_var ];
		}
	}

	return $val;

}
`

`
// Autofill a user's country based on IP

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_value_geoip_example', 10, 3 );

function salesforce_w2l_field_value_geoip_example( $val, $field, $form ){

	// Based on this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/
	// Adjust this code to the one used by your geo detection plugin

	if( !function_exists( 'geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip' ) ) return;

	$form_id = 1; // form id to act upon
	$field_name = 'country__c'; // API Name of the field you want to autofill

	if( $form == $form_id && $field_name == $field ){

		$userInfo = geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip();
		//$val = $userInfo->country->isoCode; // e.g. US
		$val = $userInfo->country->name; // e.g. United States

	}

	return $val;

}
`

`
// Autofill a date
// https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/current_time
// http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

add_filter( 'salesforce_w2l_field_value', 'salesforce_w2l_field_value_date_example', 10, 3 );

function salesforce_w2l_field_value_date_example( $val, $field, $form ){
